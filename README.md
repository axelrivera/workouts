struct TrainingLoadProcessor {
    // TRIMP = SUM(D x %HRR x 0.64e ^ y)
    // where y = %HRR x (1.92 for men, 1.67 for women)
}
```

#### **Concurrent Data Synchronization**
```swift
actor SynchronizerValues {
    // Thread-safe state management for background sync operations
    var isAuthorized = false
    var regenerate = false
}
```
